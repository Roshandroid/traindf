I fell off a train today morning. Really dumb story

So I was sleeping on the upper berth and woke up from a dream where I had gotten off a train to get someshit but the train left before I could get on it. 

I then wake up to the trains choo, and realize that I had to get off on the stop (KJM). i quickly jump of my berth and ask people what stop it is frantically. They tell its KJM and they also wisely inform me not to get off the train now and rather get off on the next stop. 
I dont pay heed to their opinion and quickly pick both my bags put on my shoes and run towards the train door. 

I feel like I'd be able to jump and run alongside the train with the right speen as I lead a very fit and active lifestyle. I reach the door and jump. Before I can take another step I fall due to the inertial law and next thing I know I get up to people scolding at me for acting like a dumbfuck,

It suddenly dawned on my like a fucking meteor. I should've just stfu sat in the train and got off on the next stop. Hmmmm


I need to draft a better version of this.
